================================

The website should have several pages, including: the home page, list all games, game review page, and an add reviews page.

Home page: Display a randomly featured game or newest game (have not decided between these two) and a short introduction on how the website works.

Games list: Show all games that have been currently reviewed on the site.

Game Reviews: After finding a game on the game list, you can view more detailed information about the game as well as read the reviews.

Add Reviews: You may add your own reviews on this page.

=================================

Currently, using databases to handle pretty much everything, such as creating reviews, adding comments, etc.

Using a plugin for a rating system right now, but may switch to using database/javascript.

The layout will be as simple as can be, and will not be elaborate unless there is enough time for it.

=================================

Currently, the core features this site must have is:
-A rating/review system
-A comment system
-A way to upload screenshots for the game

Current problems I must address are:
-How to list all games without repeating
-How to implement rating/review/comment systems
-Listing the appropriate information about the game before showing all the reviews

Future features that can be added if time permits:
-Be able to rate a user
-Be able to search for a game
-Be able to just click a button to find a random game
-Maybe sort by consoles or genre?
